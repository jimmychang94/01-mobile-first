# Mobile First

**Authors**: Jimmy Chang, Collin Meredith
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This assignment has been built to demonstrate responsive web design principles and mobile-first development. The website changes based on the viewer's window size. The primary changes are font-sizes and the style of the navigation, which switches from a vertical list on mobile to a horizontal row on desktop.

## Getting Started
All the user has to do is load the website on their preferred device. They can also test the site by re-sizing the window on a desktop browser.

## Architecture
This website is built with HTML and CSS. 
We are using SVG fonts, specifically IcoMoon, to add favicons to our navigation.

## Change Log
