#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Jimmy and Collin paired together. It took about 3.5 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started by adding the CSS meta , defining the viewport, and linking our HTML file.
  2. Next, we began styling the base CSS for our mobile-view website.
  3. Having finished the base, we moved to the mobile-view layout.
  4. Then we styled the various modules on the page.
  5. Next we added the display-nav on hover feature.
  6. Finally, we adjusted all three parts of the CSS styling for larger window view and used @media to define a transition point of 640px width.
